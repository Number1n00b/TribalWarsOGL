4) Rewrite what is not mine, or use other, industry standard, free libaries (obj_loader and stb_image).

6) Find a way to initialise GLEW outside of Display.cpp so that if it fails we can close the program. (Do memory management too, deleting context etc).

8) Find out how to draw UI elements. (Possibly use a different shader).

9) Restructure main into an app class with all the variables required, use main to initialise and start the app class.

11) Make 'escape' toggle a pause menu, during the pause menu the mouse is NOT clipped to the screen. else it is.

12) Draw text elements

13) Sound

15) Load .mtl files and learn how to use them.

18) Fix camera movement jitter / stuttering and check why normalise sometimes returns NAN in camera.
    This is due to the update being called at irregular intervals. Having a fixed - timestep loop in main would fix this issue.
    (Linear interpolation).

19) Make cross platform with ifdef guards fow windows and others.
