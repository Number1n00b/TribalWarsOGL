   Steps
============
- Do I need this file/class?
- Use #pragma once
- Check includes for redundancy.
- Check naming convention:
    Files and Classes: CamelCase
    All others: under_scores
- Efficiency: Pass references where possible.
- Sanity: Use const on references and pointers where possible.
