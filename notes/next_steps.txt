Next Steps:
===========
- Create a Catalogue class
- Move the loading of textures shaders and meshes somewhere better.....
- Decide how to deal with loading textures and meshes, should I load them all
    on startup, or should I only load them when required?




- Get text to render.
- Use text to make buttons. (Command pattern with Networking)
- Networking -> Command pattern with buttons.
