1) Edit makefile to look nicer and only link libaries when required.
2) Create tests directory and make a Makefile rule to compile tests.
3) Create a Catalogue class
4) Move the loading of textures shaders and meshes somewhere better.....
5) Decide how to deal with loading textures and meshes, should I load them all
    on startup, or should I only load them when required?




1) Get text to render.
2) Use text to make buttons. (Command pattern with Networking)
3) Networking -> Command pattern with buttons.
