Next Steps:
===========
- Render Text:
    Create a Font class that contains a map of char->Character
    Load each Font into the font catalogue
    Select font from catalogue and call Font.Reder() to render text on screen. (Every frame).
        This probably means that all text rendering would have to be part of the UI.


- Create a Catalogue class
- Move the loading of textures shaders and meshes somewhere better.....
- Decide how to deal with loading textures and meshes, should I load them all
    on startup, or should I only load them when required?


- Use text to make buttons. (Command pattern with Networking)
- Networking -> Command pattern with buttons.
