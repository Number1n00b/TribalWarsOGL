===========
Next Steps:
===========
- Make UI draw a list of elements, in priority order instead of RenderText by itself.
- Have loading of objects and UI elements be done from text files.
    - Enable objects and UI elements to be written/read to and from text files.

- Have a local copy of a file that contains the directory which to search
    for all specified resources. That way I won't even have to recompile every time,
    I can just modify that file and re-run.

- Create a Catalogue class
- Move the loading of textures shaders and meshes somewhere better.....
- Decide how to deal with loading textures and meshes, should I load them all
    on startup, or should I only load them when required?


- Use text to make buttons. (Command pattern with Networking)
- Networking -> Command pattern with buttons.
