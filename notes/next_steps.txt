Next Steps:
===========
1) Get makefiles to work with incremental builds. (Proper dependancy trees)
2) Create tests directory and make a Makefile rule to compile tests.
3) Create a HashMap/Catalogue class (also because cpp is shit)
4) Move the loading of textures shaders and meshes somewhere better.....


1) Get text to render.
