Player.cpp - L: 39-72
    rotation for player is rotating around a central axis instead of itself.




WorldObject:
    Right now I am using the exact SAME mesh and texture for all objects using
    that type. I am not even making copies. That means if I change the mesh
    at runtime for any of them, all objects using that mesh will change too.

    I should have a texture/mesh catalogue instead, so that I only have to load
    each one once, and once their loaded I can just copy the origional out for
    each world object that requires it.
