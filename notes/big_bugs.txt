Player.cpp - L: 39-72
    rotation for player is rotating around a central axis instead of itself.


WorldObject:
    Right now I am using the exact SAME mesh and texture for all objects using
    that type. I am not even making copies. That means if I change the mesh
    at runtime for any of them, all objects using that mesh will change too.



Draw() / OpenGL:
  If I fail to load a texture or mesh, the program won't even run, it will just
  crash with GLError: 1282.

  This is because the object is still technically being 'created' and added to
  the world_objects list, causing the Draw() call to use uninitialsied data.

  (makefile error -1073741819) - Probably a garbage value.
